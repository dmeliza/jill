 * The interface for a threaded data handler. The handler accepts data through the push()
 * member function and then processes it in a separate thread in an
 * implementation-specific manner.
 *
 * The handler may be in one of three states:
 *
 * Stopped: [initial state] push() accepts samples, but data is not being processed
 * Running: [Stopped=>start()] push() accepts samples, data are processed
 * Stopping: [Running=>stop()] push() drops samples while remaining samples in the
 *           buffer are flushed. Once all samples are flushed, returns to Stopped.
 *
 * data_thread objects are safe to use in realtime applications as long as the
 * methods marked as wait-free are implemented using wait-free algorithms.
